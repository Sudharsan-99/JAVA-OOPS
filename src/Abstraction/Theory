Abstraction---
1.Abstraction is defined as Hiding certain Details and showing only the
Necessary Details to The Users
2.Abstraction is achieved By the Keyword "abstract"(Abstract keyword is a non-access Modifier)
and using the abstract Classes and Methods or It can also be achieved using Interfaces
3.Abstract Classes are restricted Classes we cannot create Objects(It can only be accessed through Inheritance)
4.Abstract Method can only be used In abstract Classes
5.Abstract classes can also Have Regular Methods.

When to Use Abstraction ?
There are Some Situation In which The super class Doesn't give any Implementation for Its Methods
and the subclass should override these Methods and give its own Implementation.

Abstract Constructor ?
No abstract Constructor are not Allowed.
Because When we do it . It will show Error
Why This Error ??--Because Abstract Class has a Method without Body , This is The Same Reason for Constructors also.


Abstract Static Method ?
Can Static Method can be overridden ? Noo.....
Then Why Waste Time.
But we can create static methods in Abstract Classes and We can also have normal Methods.


Final Abstract Class--
No because we can't use "final" keyword because if it is final
Then we can't Override but it can contain Final variable


Multiple Inheritance can't be achieved using Abstraction
