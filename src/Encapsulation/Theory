Encapsulation---
1.Encapsulation is wrapping up the implementaton of data Members and methods in a single class
2.It basically Hides the data in a single unit inorder to prevent it from seeing from outside
3.It is acheived with the help of Access Modifiers(mainly "private")
4.For better Understanding Let consider a class Human .
5.Now Human Class have Instance variable like age and Name.
6.I make the Age and Name a "Private" . so now when we try to create an object for human class and assign the
values for the objects age and Name "we get an error" this is called as ENCAPSULATION
7.Inorder to achieve it we have to craete public method for setting and getting the age and Name
8.example--getAge(),getName(),Setage(),SetName()...

technically in encapasulation the varaible or data of a class is hidden from any other class and it canbe only
assessed by through any member function of its own class.

Advantages---
1.Data Hiding
2.Flexibility--User can make the variable as read only or write only.
3.Reuseability
