                                        POLYMORPHISM
   Definition-The Act of Representing Same things in Multiple Ways
   Poly means many
   Morphism means Ways to Represent
   A Language that doesn't Allow Polymorphism is Called as "Object Assisted Language" not a OOPS language.

   Note---
       1.The Definition Of the Function Should be Same

   Types of Polymorphism---
        1.Static or Compile Time polymorphism--
                    * In Java two or more methods with same Name in a Class is Allowed , But They Should have
                      Different "Return Type" or "Different Ordering Of Parameters" or "Different Type of Argument"
                      or "Type".
                    * While overloaded methods may have different return types, the return type alone is insufficient to distinguish two
                      versions of a method. When Java encounters a call to an overloaded method, it simply executes the version of the method
                      whose parameters match the arguments used in the call.
                    * Example--Multiple Constructors

             Error Happens When--
                    * public static int add(int a,int b){
                              return a+b;
                          }
                      public static void add(int a,int b){
                              int n= a+b;
                              System.out.println(n);
                          }
                    *here error Occurs Because of this--
                                            In Java, method overloading allows multiple methods to have the
                                            same name but different parameters (different type, number, or both).
                                            However, you cannot have two methods with the same name and the exact same parameter types,
                                            even if their return types are different.

        2.Dynamic or Run Time Polymorphism--
